                <h3 id="why-this-addon-is-better-than-others">Why this addon is better than others?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, there are some addons for Blender that use Stable Diffusion. 
But all addons known to the author are very simple and are hardly suitable for professional work. <br />
These addons allow you to generate only one shot from one position of camera, do not provide opportunities for customizing the process,
do not use the full power of ControlNet, and do not provide convenient tools for projecting several layers onto the model and creating a complete texture.</li>
<li>Neural Master is the only tool that provides a complete texturing pipeline, allowing you to completely create a diffuse texture for your model.</li>
<li>Neural Master supports all the possibilities of Automatic 1111, including many ControlNet layers and provides rich opportunities to customize neural pipeline. </li>
<li>The author tried to make the tool convenient so that all operations are performed as quickly and conveniently as possible, and so that you can easily integrate the addon into your processes.</li>
<li>Neural Master can connect to any host of Automatic1111, local or remote</li>
<li>Neural Master is actively being developed, having documentation and support</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-is-this-plugin-better-than-txt-2-3d-technologies">How is this plugin better than txt-2-3d technologies</h3>
<p>The question is not correct because they are the different tools. 
Мы не конкуренты, и, более того, в недалеком будущем NeuralMaster обязательно будет поддерживать работу с моделями txt-2-3d 
But This question is been asked that's why is the answer.
- The authors of <strong>txt-2-3d are</strong> trying to create the <strong>technologies of the future</strong> - full-fledged generation of a 3D model, including geometry and texture.
This future may come very soon, perhaps within a year-two-three, but perhaps not,<br />
and today this future has not yet arrived - we see that modern text-2-3d tools are <strong>too raw to use them in practical applications</strong>. 
  - They very poorly related to standard modeling pipeline, so it's difficult to use them in practice. 
They are trying to replace the modeler rather than help him with his work. 
  - They generate 3D models with a very strange topology, having a lot of bugs 
  - They do not allow to modify and improve the model after it's been generation
  - They do not contain tools for controlling generation process
- Neural Master is more simple tool that does not try to cover and replace the entire modeling process, but it helps to improve texturing. 
  - NeuralMaster don't try to remove 3d-modelers from modeling process. Instead, it appends a new possibilities to common modeling pipeline. 
  - NeuralMaster is an addon for Blender, familiar development environment, but not an external tool that's why it's maximally simple to use it.  <br />
  - Neural Master a tool, based on modern proven and well-functioning technologies txt2img/img2img, including Controlnet - the most development modern for controlling neural generation process.
  - NeuralMaster don't create geometry of model and UV, and you can fully control this process.
  - NeuralMaster is a complete product, having documentation and support  </p>
<h3 id="plans">Plans</h3>
<p>The addon is actively being developed. Plans for 2024:
- Technical support for users, polishing and optimization of tools.
- Improving the consistency of the generated image by supporting open txt-2-3d solutions.
- ComfyUI support, which will allow users to create even more complex custom pipelines and improve the quality of texturing
- Support for other txt2img and img2img models (if they have an open interface).
- Generation of not only a diffuse texture, but individual components of more complex shading.
- Using txt2img and img2img models not only for texturing, but also for detailing the model geometry.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>If you have been sleeping somewhere for the last 2 years and are hearing about the txt2img and img2img models for the first time, then the results of Neural Master will also seem like real magic to you.
But in reality, many 2D artists are already successfully using Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and D-ALLY as a powerful tool that gives new possibilities that were not previously available. 
<br>What was recently magic has become a tool.</p>
<p>Today Neural Master makes it possible for 3D artists to also experience the full power of this tool.</p>
