<h1>NeuralMaster</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In today's landscape, where incredible machine learning technologies such as Chat GPT, Stable Diffusion, 
and DALLÂ·E are transforming the creation of text and 2D imagery, 3D modeling remains somewhat behind in harnessing these innovative strides. <br />
Neural networks solutions designed for 3D modeling, like txt-2-3d models, are indeed evolving,
but they currently struggle to meet practical needs, often yielding results that are of low quality, impractical, and lack control of generation.
And it seems strange the insistence with which many researchers and startups are trying to create a one-button 3D generator, ignoring the real needs and workflows of 3D artists.</p>

<p>We believe that neural 3d art tools must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be not only high technology but also practical, usable and artist-friendly;</li>
<li>be designed for 3d artists but not against 3d artists, to enhance, not replace, their skill;</li>
<li>help today but not tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NeuralMaster</strong> addon is our small step in this direction.  </p>

<p>It is a tool designed to bridge the gap between the world of ML technologies and 3d modeling, 
to simplify and improve the work of 3d artists. </p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Neural Mmaster is a diffuse texturing addon for Blender based on StaveDiffusion+ControlNet, that allow to control over the texture creation at all stages.
As far as we know, today, this is the only available product based on txt2img/img2img models that allows you to create an entire diffuse texture.</p>

<p>Whether you're fully generating textures or want to improve the details of existing textures, our solution seamlessly integrates with your familiar 3D pipelines, 
harnessing the power of Stable Diffusion+ControlNet inside Blender.</p>

<p>It is not magic[*] and not a one-button solution. Working in Neural Master requires some knowledge of 3D modeling and texturing,
and knowledge in the field of neural art, but in multiple cases this definitely simplifies the texturing process and saves your time.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Generating multiple shots of the model from different views, rather than just a single snapshot.  </li>
<li>Convenient tools for combining shots into a single texture, allowing to texture the entire model.</li>
<li>Maximum possible control over the generation process, which allows you to create not just a beautiful picture, but what you need.</li>
<li>Advanced customization settings. NeuralMaster does not impose a specific neural pipeline, but it is a product for creating pipelines.  </li>
<li>NeuralMaster is an addon for one of the most powerful 3d editors that allow to combine neural pipeline with the power of 3d modeling in every step of texturing.</li>
<li>A multitude of small tools and adaptations that accelerate the texturing process, such as camera control tools, sorting and setting texture layers, editing and fast transformation of masks, playing your texturing process, and many others.  </li>
<li>Support for working with a remote SD server, not just a local one.  </li>
<li>The project is in an active phase of development and continuously evolving. </li>
</ul>
