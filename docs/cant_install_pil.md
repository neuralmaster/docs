# I can't install PIL library

NeuralMaster requires an additional library 'Pillow' (PIL).
If your computer has several python installations (for example several Blender instances), this can be the reason for problems of installing.
Also I am not sure that this always works fine on Linux and Mac because I don't have enough feedback about these platforms.  


If my installer does not work please use one the following ways:

1. Use the addon 'Blender - Python Module Installer' to install the library  
    1. Download the addon here ['Blender - Python Module Installer'](https://cgfigures.gumroad.com/l/pymodinstall)    
    2. Use this video instruction [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRha-8Zk8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRha-8Zk8w)   
    1. Install the module 'Pillow'
   
2. As an alternative way you can use the script [https://github.com/luckychris/install_blender_python_modules](https://github.com/luckychris/install_blender_python_modules).  
that does the same, but it is a python script, not an addon. I think that using the Blender addon above is more convenient.


3. If you still can't install the module please reinstall Blender.  

    -  Fully delete the Blender instance.  
    -  Install it again.  
    -  On Windows systems I suggest you donâ€™t install Blender to the default "Program files..." folders, because this folder is protected from writing and this can be the reason for installing problems.  


If you still can't install it, please write to me and to the discord channel, I will help you.
